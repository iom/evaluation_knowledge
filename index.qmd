## Evaluation, Evidence & Knowledge

 An **Evaluation Evidence Map** is a structured, visual tool that organizes what we know—and don’t know—about programs, policies, and interventions. Think of it as a research landscape that helps decision-makers quickly understand:

- Which interventions have been evaluated  
- Where they were implemented  
- What outcomes were observed  
- Where critical knowledge gaps remain  

This approach is especially valuable for evidence-informed project design, particularly when time or resources limit the ability to read through hundreds of individual evaluation reports (see [UNICEF Evidence Map example](https://evaluationreports.unicef.org/app/evaluation-evidence-gap-map.html)).

The goal of this exercise is to inform future evaluation design, guide strategic planning, and support the development of robust, evidence-based project proposals and strategic plan.


## Introduction

This notebook implements an evidence mapping system with:
 - Batch processing for scalability
 - Robust error handling and retries
 - Embedding caching
 - Hybrid search (vector + full-text)
 - Local LanceDB deployment

we can follow these steps:

 - Load the JSON file containing the URLs of the PDF reports.
 - Load the Excel file describing the IOM Results Framework.
 - Download and process the PDF reports to extract text.
 - Integrate the extracted text with the IOM Results Framework.
 - Generate embeddings and store them in LanceDB. 


------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Step 0: Environment Set up

The body of this document targets a technical audience. Below are all the codes so that the whole process can be reproduced and audited. This assume to use the following code within [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

### Virtual Environment
First we need to use a virtual environment in Python development. This is essential for managing dependencies, avoiding conflicts, and ensuring reproducibility. It allows you to isolate project-specific libraries and versions, preventing interference with other projects or the global Python installation. This isolation helps maintain a clean development environment, simplifies project setup for collaborators, and enhances security by reducing the risk of introducing vulnerabilities. Overall, virtual environments provide a consistent and organized way to manage your Python projects effectively.

Make sure to install the last [stable version of python language](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and create a dedicated python environment to have a fresh install where to manage correctly all the dependencies between packages. To specify a particular version of Python when creating a virtual environment, you can use the full path to the desired Python executable. Here is how you can do it:

Open your terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell, or any terminal emulator).

Navigate to your project directory where you want to create the virtual environment.

Run the following command to create a virtual environment,here called **`.venv`**:

```{bash}
#| eval: false 
python -m venv .venv
```

Then, activate the virtual environment:
```{bash} 
#| eval: false
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
```


Then, configure visual Studio Code to use the virtual environment: Open the Command Palette using the shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+P` and type `Jupyter: Select Interpreter` and select the interpreter that corresponds to your newly created virtual environment: `('venv': venv)`.


### Required Python Modules

Once this environment selected as a kernel to run the notebook, we can install the required python modules the rest of the process:

```{python} 
%pip install openai  lancedb pyarrow pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly pymupdf requests tqdm tenacity ipython dotenv langchain langchain-community langchain_openai  ipywidgets openpyxl  filetype
```


then Restart the jupyter kernel for this notebook
```{python}
#| eval: false
%reset -f
```

### Initialise LLM API

```{python} 
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
# Load environment variables
load_dotenv()

from langchain_openai import AzureChatOpenAI 
# Initialize LLM with higher temperature for creative question generation
llm_creative = AzureChatOpenAI(
    deployment_name=os.getenv("AZURE_DEPLOYMENT_NAME"),
    api_key=os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY"),
    azure_endpoint=os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT"),
    api_version=os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION"),
    temperature=0.7,
    max_tokens=500
)

llm_accurate = AzureChatOpenAI(
    deployment_name=os.getenv("AZURE_DEPLOYMENT_NAME"),
    api_key=os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY"),
    azure_endpoint=os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT"),
    api_version=os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION"),
    temperature=0.1,
    max_tokens=1000
)


```


### Load PDF library and Strategic Results Framework

The library

```{python} 
import pandas as pd
import openpyxl
import json
def load_evaluations(file_path,json_path):
    # Load the Excel file
    df = pd.read_excel(file_path, sheet_name='extract from 2005 to Aug 2024', engine='openpyxl')
    
    # Filter evaluations from 2005 to August 2024
    filtered_df = df 
    
    # Create a nested structure
    evaluations = []
    for _, row in filtered_df.iterrows():
        evaluation = {
            "Title": row["Title"],
            "Year": str(row["Year"]),
            "Author": row["Author"],
            "Best Practices or Lessons Learnt": row["Best Practicesor Lessons Learnt"],
            "Date of Publication": str(row["Date of Publication"]),
            "Donor": row["Donor"],
            "Evaluation Brief": row["Evaluation Brief"],
            "Evaluation Commissioner": row["Evaluation Commissioner"],
            "Evaluation Coverage": row["Evaluation Coverage"],
            "Evaluation Period From Date": str(row["Evaluation Period From Date"]),
            "Evaluation Period To Date": str(row["Evaluation Period To Date"]),
            "Executive Summary": row["Executive Summary"],
            "External Version of the Report": row["External Version of the Report"],
            "Languages": row["Languages"],
            "Migration Thematic Areas": row["Migration Thematic Areas"],
            "Name of Project(s) Being Evaluated": row["Name of Project(s) Being Evaluated"],
            "Number of Pages Excluding annexes": row["Number of Pages Excluding annexes"],
            "Other Documents Included": row["Other Documents Included"],
            "Project Code": row["Project Code"],
            "Countries Covered": [country.strip() for country in str(row["Countries Covered"]).split(",")],
            "Regions Covered": row["Regions Covered"],
            "Relevant Crosscutting Themes": row["Relevant Crosscutting Themes"],
            "Report Published": row["Report Published"],
            "Terms of Reference": row["Terms of Reference"],
            "Type of Evaluation Scope": row["Type of Evaluation Scope"],
            "Type of Evaluation Timing": row["Type of Evaluation Timing"],
            "Type of Evaluator": row["Type of Evaluator"],
            "Level of Evaluation": row["Level of Evaluation"],
            "Documents": []
        }
        
        # Split the document-related fields by comma and create a list of dictionaries
        document_subtypes = str(row["Document Subtype"]).split(", ")
        file_urls = str(row["File URL"]).split(", ")
        file_descriptions = str(row["File description"]).split(", ")
        
        for subtype, url, description in zip(document_subtypes, file_urls, file_descriptions):
            document = {
                "Document Subtype": subtype,
                "File URL": url,
                "File description": description
            }
            evaluation["Documents"].append(document)
        
        evaluations.append(evaluation)

    ## dump data
    with open(json_path, 'w') as json_file:
        json.dump(evaluations, json_file, indent=4)

    
    return evaluations
```

```{python} 
library =load_evaluations("reference/Evaluation_repository.xlsx","reference/Evaluation_repository.json" )
```


Now the framework

```{python} 
import pandas as pd
import openpyxl
def load_iom_framework(excel_path: str) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """Load and validate IOM framework"""
    df = pd.read_excel(excel_path)
    
    # Validate expected columns
    required_columns = ['Objective', 'Outcome', 'Indicator']
    for col in required_columns:
        assert col in df.columns, f"Framework missing required column: {col}"
    
    return df
```

```{python}
framework= load_iom_framework("reference/Strategic_Result_Framework.xlsx")    
```

## Step 1: Building the Knowledge Base

So we have a collection of Evaluation documents. We have metadata for each Evaluation. For each evaluation, we have multiple documents (The evaluation report itslef, plus in some case: a summary brief, annexes, etc.)

See an example below
```{json}

Workflow Overview

1. Load external metadata for one evaluations as per json file.
2. Then for each evaluation, download the file, convert it to PDF (in case it's a word, excel or ppt), and load text for each document.
3. Then implement a [late chunking that can solve the lost context problem](https://isaacflath.com/blog/blog_post?fpath=posts%2F2025-04-08-LateChunking.ipynb) and  insert in chunk table, enabling [Hybrid Search capability](https://docs.lancedb.com/core/hybrid-search) so that search can be made based on both key words and similirarity.
4. Create additional metadata for both documents and for evaluation using an LLM call. the additional metadata shall help to define an asesssment of the "evidence strenght". The metadata to be created are - evaluation type (formative, summative, impact), Methodology, study design, sample size, and data collection techniques  



### Initialize LanceDB Vector Database

The database includes 23 tables: 

__1. Evaluations Table__
Each row represents a unique evaluation with the following fields:

* evaluation_id (unique identifier)
* title 
* author
* practice_or_lessons
* donor
* is_brief
* commissioner
* coverage
* countries
* from_date
* to_date
* has_summary
* external_version
* language
* thematic_area
* name_project
* project_code
* evaluation_scope
* evaluation_timing
* evaluation_level
* evaluator_type
* theme
* cross_cutting

additional variable will be generated through an LLM prompt on the entire evaluation content

* short_title 
* summary
* population (PICO model)
* intervention (PICO model)
* comparator (PICO model)
* outcome (PICO model)
* methodology
* study_type
* study_design
* sample_size
* data_collection_techniques
* evidence_strength 
* limitations 


__2. Documents Table__

Each row represents a PDF file linked to an evaluation:
 
* document_id: Primary key   ID of the original PDF
* evaluation_id: foreign key to link to the evaluation
* document_subtype: from the original metadata
* document_url: from the original metadata
* document_name: from the original metadata 
* document_tite:  document type as reviewed by the LLM
* document_type_infer: document type as reviewed by the LLM
* document_processed: boolean to confirm it is done


__3. Chunk Table__
* chunk_id: Primary key  
* evaluation_id: foreign key to link to the evaluation
* document_id: ID of the original file
* document_page: for proper referencing of any further information retrieval
* chunk_index: order of the chunk in the document
* text: the chunked content
* embedding (for hybrid search)

Let's start by loading the library from json...

```{python}
from typing import List, Dict, Optional # Type hinting
import json
def load_evaluations(json_path: str) -> List[Dict]:
    """Load evaluation data from a JSON file
    
    Args:
        json_path: Path to the JSON file containing evaluation data
        
    Returns:
        List of evaluation dictionaries
    """
    try:
        with open(json_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
            data = json.load(f)
            
        # Handle both single evaluation and list of evaluations
        if isinstance(data, dict):
            return [data]
        elif isinstance(data, list):
            return data
        else:
            raise ValueError("Invalid JSON structure - expected object or array")
            
    except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
        print(f"Error decoding JSON file {json_path}: {e}")
        return []
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error loading evaluation data: {e}")
        return []
```

Load a small subset for testing..

```{python}    
# Load your   metadata
#evaluation_data =  load_evaluations("reference/Evaluation_repository_test.json")
evaluation_data =  load_evaluations("reference/Evaluation_repository.json")
print(f"Attribute name is: {evaluation_data}")
print(type(evaluation_data))
```

Id Generation

```{python}
import hashlib
def generate_id(text: str) -> str:
    """Generate a deterministic ID from text"""
    return hashlib.md5(text.encode()).hexdigest()
```

```{python}
eval_id = generate_id( "aaa")
print({eval_id})
```


```{python}
import time
import shutil
def force_delete_directory(path, max_retries=3, delay=1):
    """Robust directory deletion with retries and delay"""
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            if os.path.exists(path):
                shutil.rmtree(path)
                return True
        except Exception as e:
            if attempt == max_retries - 1:
                print(f"Failed to delete {path} after {max_retries} attempts: {e}")
                return False
            time.sleep(delay)
    return False

force_delete_directory(LANCE_DB_PATH)
```

We start prefilling our vector database with the metadata

    initialise_knowledge_base(db, evaluation)

Let's check each evaluation is in the DB -
```{python}
eval_table = db.open_table("evaluations")
#  Convert to Pandas DataFrame (recommended for display)
df = eval_table.to_pandas()
print(df)
```

and the corresponding documents...
```{python}
LANCE_DB_PATH = "./lancedb"
from lancedb import connect
db = connect(LANCE_DB_PATH)
doc_table = db.open_table("documents")
#  Convert to Pandas DataFrame (recommended for display)
df = doc_table.to_pandas()
print(df)
# this table includes document_id, url, and evaluation_id
```

### Download and prepare all the files

Now we build a smart function to download the files from  URL:
 - this function takes an argument the `doc_table` from the vector DB (`doc_table = db.open_table("documents")`). this table includes document_id, url, and evaluation_id
 - then for each document, and in parallelised way, it loads the url and extract the `file_name` from the `url` within the table
 - it builds a local `file_path` with `PDF_Library`/`evaluation_id`/`file_name` (where `PDF_Library` is an environment variable) 
 - it checks if the 'file_name' is already present and then gracefully exit
 - if not, it downloads the file_name - this done with with some provision to avoid requesting IP being banned - and ensure some retry until the file is downloaded
 - if the file_name extension is not pdf, it identify the file extension then it converts it to pdf

Testing this...

```{python}
doc_table = db.open_table("documents")
os.environ["PDF_Library"] = "Evaluation_Library"
download_documents(doc_table)
```

### Now load file content in the vector DB, chunk and embedd

Building a function that 
 - this function takes an argument the `doc_table` from the vector DB (`doc_table = db.open_table("documents")`). this table includes document_id, url, and evaluation_id, processed
 - then for each document, and in parallelised way, it loads the url and extract the `file_name` from the `url` within the table
 - it assume a local `file_path` with `PDF_Library`/`evaluation_id`/`file_name` (where `PDF_Library` is an environment variable - `file_name` is extracted from the url - and the `file_name` extension is sanitised to include systematically '.pdf' ) 
 - It will extract the text from the PDF using PyMuPDF with error handling
-- it will implement the  It will then fill in the chunk table in lancedb, implementing a late chunking approach to avoid duplicate embedding computation, ensure context-aware chunk boundaries and precise span tracking .
- the lancedb chunk table schema should be 
    - chunk_id: str
    - document_id: str
    - evaluation_id: str
    - metadata: dict[str, str] 
    - content: str = embedding_fn.SourceField()
    - vector: Vector(embedding_fn.ndims()) = embedding_fn.VectorField() 
- Once processed the  processed variable in doc_table is set to true   


Test the embeddings through lanchain....
```{python}
# Initialize embeddings
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv 
load_dotenv()
from langchain_openai import AzureOpenAIEmbeddings
embedding_model = AzureOpenAIEmbeddings(
    deployment=os.getenv("EMBEDDING_MODEL"),
    api_key=os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY"),
    azure_endpoint=os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT"),
    api_version=os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION_EMBED"),
    chunk_size=1
)

test_embedding = embedding_model.embed_query("Hello world")
print(f"Embedding vector length: {len(test_embedding)}")
embedding_dim = len(test_embedding)
# LanceDB-compatible wrapper
class LangchainEmbeddingWrapper:
    def __init__(self, langchain_embedder):
        self._embedder = langchain_embedder

    def __call__(self, texts):
        return self._embedder.embed_documents(texts)
        
    def ndims(self):
        return self._dim

# Wrap and use
embedding_fn = LangchainEmbeddingWrapper(embedding_model)
#print("Embedding dimension:", embedding_fn.ndims())

vec = embedding_fn(["Hello world"])
print(f"Vector through lancedb dim: {len(vec[0])}")
print(embedding_fn(["Hello world"])[0])

```

```{python}
print(dir(embedding_fn))
help(embedding_fn)
```

So first we create the chunk table in lancedb 
```{python}
from pydantic import BaseModel
from lancedb.pydantic import Vector
import pyarrow as pa 
pa_schema = pa.schema([
    pa.field("chunk_id", pa.string()),
    pa.field("document_id", pa.string()),
    pa.field("evaluation_id", pa.string()),
    pa.field("metadata", pa.string()),  # storing metadata dict as JSON string for simplicity
    pa.field("content", pa.string()),
    pa.field("vector", pa.list_(pa.float32(), embedding_dim)),  # vector as list of floats
])

from lancedb import connect
db = connect(LANCE_DB_PATH)
chunk_table = db.create_table("chunks", schema=pa_schema)

```

and then the function creating embeddings chunck for each document

process_documents_to_chunks(doc_table, chunk_table)
```

Checking the status of the chunking process

```{python}
def check_chunk_status(doc_table, chunk_table):
    import pandas as pd

    # Load documents and chunks as DataFrames
    docs_df = doc_table.to_pandas()
    chunks_df = chunk_table.to_pandas()

    # Count chunks per document_id
    chunk_counts = chunks_df.groupby("document_id").size().reset_index(name="chunk_count")

    # Merge chunk counts into docs_df (left join)
    merged = docs_df.merge(chunk_counts, on="document_id", how="left")

    # Fill NaN chunk counts with 0 (documents with no chunks)
    merged["chunk_count"] = merged["chunk_count"].fillna(0).astype(int)

    # Define which docs are missing chunks or have zero chunks
    missing_chunks_df = merged[merged["chunk_count"] == 0]

    # Summary counts
    total_docs = len(docs_df)
    properly_chunked = total_docs - len(missing_chunks_df)
    missing_count = len(missing_chunks_df)

    print(f"Total documents: {total_docs}")
    print(f"Properly chunked documents: {properly_chunked}")
    print(f"Documents missing chunks: {missing_count}")

    if missing_count > 0:
        print("\nDocuments missing chunks:")
        for _, row in missing_chunks_df.iterrows():
            doc_id = row["document_id"]
            url = row.get("url", "N/A")
            processed = row.get("processed", False)
            print(f" - Document ID: {doc_id}, URL: {url}, Processed flag: {processed}")

    return missing_chunks_df
```

```{python}

db = connect(LANCE_DB_PATH)
doc_table = db.open_table("documents")
chunk_table = db.open_table("chunks")
missing_docs_df = check_chunk_status(doc_table, chunk_table)
print(missing_docs_df)
# this table includes document_id, url, and evaluation_id
```

### Generating AI-Enhanced metadata 

Last, we run a function to generate metadata... 

The function will load the "evaluations" table within the db --connect(LANCE_DB_PATH) --
then loop around each evaluation_id within the "chunks" table to retrive the context - and 
perform an LLM call to then generate as an output additional metadata
Then it will update the evaluations table with the output for each evaluation -
At the end it will save a json file with a dump of the evaluations table

We will use the  __PICO structured framework__ as an approach to represent the causal knowledge found in the Evaluation (cf. [EconBERTa: Towards Robust Extraction of Named Entities in Economics](https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-emnlp.774.pdf)). This scheme helps in systematically organizing and analyzing the effectiveness of interventions by comparing outcomes between groups:

__1. Population (P)__:  The group of individuals or units (e.g., households, schools, firms) affected by the intervention. The target population shall be clearly defined (e.g., smallholder farmers, primary school students, unemployed youth) and it shall Include eligibility criteria (e.g., age, socioeconomic status, geographic location).

__2. Intervention (I)__: The program, policy, or treatment whose effect is being evaluated. Describes the active component being tested (e.g., cash transfers, training workshops, new teaching methods). Should specify dosage, duration, and delivery mechanism.

__3. Comparators (C)__: The counterfactual scenario—what would have happened without the intervention. Ideally involves a control group (if the study approach is randomized or quasi-experimental) that does not receive the intervention. Alternatively refers to "Business-as-usual" groups, placebo interventions, or different treatment arms.

__4. Outcome (O)__:The measurable effects or endpoints used to assess the intervention’s impact. Includes primary outcomes (main indicators of interest, e.g., school enrollment rates, income levels) and secondary outcomes (e.g., health, empowerment). Should be specific, measurable, and time-bound (e.g., "child literacy scores after 12 months").


Using such approach, we can ensure Clarity (the research question is well-defined and testable), Causal Inference (isolate the effect of the intervention by comparing treated and untreated groups), Replicability (to potentially extrapolate the findings) and Relevance (linking outcomes to real-world decision-making).

## Step 4: Generate Actionable and Generalizable Insights  

One key challenge is How to generalize the findings from an evaluation from one place to another one? The [Generalizability Framework](https://ssir.org/articles/entry/the_generalizability_puzzle) provides some insights on how to do that.


To implement this we will generate insights using AI-enabled Q&A on all previous Q&A:

```{python} 
def generate_insights(df):
    # Add your insight generation logic here
    return df

df = generate_insights(df)
```

## Step 5: Identify Patterns and Gaps

Identify patterns and gaps in the data:

```{python} 
def identify_patterns(df):
    # Add your pattern identification logic here
    return df

df = identify_patterns(df)
```


### Generate Deliverables


```{python} 
def generate_deliverables(df):
    # Generate Q&A dataset
    qa_dataset = df[['question', 'answer']]

    # Generate synthesis report
    synthesis_report = df.describe()

    # Generate visual evidence map
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    sns.scatterplot(data=df, x='outcome', y='population', size='sample_size')
    plt.title('Visual Evidence Map')
    plt.show()

    return qa_dataset, synthesis_report

qa_dataset, synthesis_report = generate_deliverables(df)
```

### Visualize Patterns & Gaps

```{python} 
# Convert QA to structured fields (intervention, outcome, population, etc.)
qa_df = pd.json_normalize(df_docs["qa"].apply(json.loads))

# Bubble Map Example
fig = px.scatter(qa_df, x="geography", y="outcome",

                 hover_name="file_name",
                 title="Evidence Bubble Map")
fig.show()

# Heatmap Example
heatmap_df = pd.crosstab(qa_df["intervention"], qa_df["outcome"])
sns.heatmap(heatmap_df, annot=True, cmap="coolwarm")
```

### Save Deliverables

Save the deliverables to files:

```{python} 
qa_dataset.to_csv('qa_dataset.csv', index=False)
synthesis_report.to_csv('synthesis_report.csv')
```


## Conclusions - and potential extension...

* Web interface (Streamlit, Gradio, etc.)

* Periodic syncing with new evaluations via web scraping

* Integration with Hugging Face for fine-tuning a summarization or Q&A model
