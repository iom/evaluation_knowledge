## Introduction

This notebook implements an evidence mapping system with:

 - Batch processing for scalability

 - Robust error handling and retries

 - Embedding caching

 - Hybrid search (vector + full-text)
 
 - Local LanceDB deployment

we can follow these steps:

 - Load the JSON file containing the URLs of the PDF reports.
 - Load the Excel file describing the IOM Results Framework.
 - Download and process the PDF reports to extract text.
 - Integrate the extracted text with the IOM Results Framework.
 - Generate embeddings and store them in LanceDB. 

## Setup

### Create a Virtual Environment

To ensure a clean and isolated environment for this project, we will create a virtual environment using Python's `venv` module. This will help manage dependencies and avoid conflicts with other projects.


```{bash} 
#| eval: false
python -m venv .venv
```


Then, activate the virtual environment:

```{bash} 
#| eval: false
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
```



Then, configure visual Studio Code to use the virtual environment: Open the Command Palette using the shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+P` and type `Jupyter: Select Interpreter` and select the interpreter that corresponds to your newly created virtual environment: `('venv': venv)`.


### Required Python Modules

Once this environment selected as a kernel to run the notebook, we can install the required python modules the rest of the process:


```{python} 
%pip install openai  lancedb pyarrow pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly pymupdf requests tqdm tenacity ipython dotenv langchain langchain-community langchain_openai  ipywidgets openpyxl  filetype
```



then Restart the jupyter kernel for this notebook

```{python}
#| eval: false
%reset -f
```


### Initialise LLM API

::: {#llmapi .cell}
``` {.python .cell-code}
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
# Load environment variables
load_dotenv()

from langchain_openai import AzureChatOpenAI 
# Initialize LLM with higher temperature for creative question generation
llm_creative = AzureChatOpenAI(
    deployment_name=os.getenv("AZURE_DEPLOYMENT_NAME"),
    api_key=os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY"),
    azure_endpoint=os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT"),
    api_version=os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION"),
    temperature=0.7,
    max_tokens=500
)

llm_accurate = AzureChatOpenAI(
    deployment_name=os.getenv("AZURE_DEPLOYMENT_NAME"),
    api_key=os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY"),
    azure_endpoint=os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT"),
    api_version=os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION"),
    temperature=0.1,
    max_tokens=1000
)
```

## Step 1: Building the Knowledge Base

So we have a collection of Evaluation documents. We have metadata for each Evaluation. For each evaluation, we have multiple documents (The evaluation report itslef, plus in some case: a summary brief, annexes, etc.)

See an example below

Workflow Overview

1. Load external metadata for one evaluations as per json file.
2. Then for each evaluation, download the file, convert it to PDF (in case it's a word, excel or ppt), and load text for each document.
3. Then implement a [late chunking that can solve the lost context problem](https://isaacflath.com/blog/blog_post?fpath=posts%2F2025-04-08-LateChunking.ipynb) and  insert in chunk table, enabling [Hybrid Search capability](https://docs.lancedb.com/core/hybrid-search) so that search can be made based on both key words and similirarity.
4. Create additional metadata for both documents and for evaluation using an LLM call. the additional metadata shall help to define an asesssment of the "evidence strenght". The metadata to be created are - evaluation type (formative, summative, impact), Methodology, study design, sample size, and data collection techniques  


### Initialize LanceDB Vector Database

The database includes 23 tables: 

__1. Evaluations Table__
Each row represents a unique evaluation with the following fields:

* evaluation_id (unique identifier)
* title 
* author
* practice_or_lessons
* donor
* is_brief
* commissioner
* coverage
* countries
* from_date
* to_date
* has_summary
* external_version
* language
* thematic_area
* name_project
* project_code
* evaluation_scope
* evaluation_timing
* evaluation_level
* evaluator_type
* theme
* cross_cutting

additional variable will be generated through an LLM prompt on the entire evaluation content

* short_title 
* summary
* population (PICO model)
* intervention (PICO model)
* comparator (PICO model)
* outcome (PICO model)
* methodology
* study_type
* study_design
* sample_size
* data_collection_techniques
* evidence_strength 
* limitations 


__2. Documents Table__

Each row represents a PDF file linked to an evaluation:
 
* document_id: Primary key   ID of the original PDF
* evaluation_id: foreign key to link to the evaluation
* document_subtype: from the original metadata
* document_url: from the original metadata
* document_name: from the original metadata 
* document_tite:  document type as reviewed by the LLM
* document_type_infer: document type as reviewed by the LLM
* document_processed: boolean to confirm it is done


__3. Chunk Table__
* chunk_id: Primary key  
* evaluation_id: foreign key to link to the evaluation
* document_id: ID of the original file
* document_page: for proper referencing of any further information retrieval
* chunk_index: order of the chunk in the document
* text: the chunked content
* embedding (for hybrid search)

Let's start by loading the library from json...

### load_evaluations

>      load_evaluations (json_path:str)

*Load evaluation data from a JSON file

Args:
    json_path: Path to the JSON file containing evaluation data

Returns:
    List of evaluation dictionaries*


Load a small subset for testing..

::: {#cell-17 .cell}
``` {.python .cell-code}
# Load your   metadata
#evaluation_data =  load_evaluations("reference/Evaluation_repository_test.json")
evaluation_data =  load_evaluations("reference/Evaluation_repository.json")

### generate_id

>      generate_id (text:str)

*Generate a deterministic ID from text*


::: {#cell-20 .cell}

eval_id = generate_id( "aaa")
print({eval_id})
```
:::

### force_delete_directory

>      force_delete_directory (path, max_retries=3, delay=1)

*Robust directory deletion with retries and delay*


::: {#cell-22 .cell}
``` {.python .cell-code}
force_delete_directory(LANCE_DB_PATH)
```
:::


We start prefilling our vector database with the metadata

### initialise_knowledge_base

>      initialise_knowledge_base (db, evaluation:Dict)

*Store full documents without chunking (late chunking approach)*


---

[source](https://github.com/iom/evaluation_knowledge/blob/main/evaluation_knowledge/core.py#L164){target="_blank" style="float:right; font-size:smaller"}

### safe_get

>      safe_get (d, key, default=None)

*Safely get value from dict, handle NaN and missing keys*


::: {#cell-26 .cell}
``` {.python .cell-code}
LANCE_DB_PATH = "./lancedb"
db = connect(LANCE_DB_PATH)
for evaluation in evaluation_data:  # Assuming evaluation_data is a list
    initialise_knowledge_base(db, evaluation)
```
:::


Let's check each evaluation is in the DB -

::: {#cell-28 .cell}
``` {.python .cell-code}
eval_table = db.open_table("evaluations")
#  Convert to Pandas DataFrame (recommended for display)
df = eval_table.to_pandas()
print(df)
```
:::


and the corresponding documents...

::: {#cell-30 .cell}
``` {.python .cell-code}
LANCE_DB_PATH = "./lancedb"
from lancedb import connect
db = connect(LANCE_DB_PATH)
doc_table = db.open_table("documents")
#  Convert to Pandas DataFrame (recommended for display)
df = doc_table.to_pandas()
print(df)
# this table includes document_id, url, and evaluation_id
```
:::


### Download and prepare all the files

Now we build a smart function to download the files from  URL:
 - this function takes an argument the `doc_table` from the vector DB (`doc_table = db.open_table("documents")`). this table includes document_id, url, and evaluation_id
 - then for each document, and in parallelised way, it loads the url and extract the `file_name` from the `url` within the table
 - it builds a local `file_path` with `PDF_Library`/`evaluation_id`/`file_name` (where `PDF_Library` is an environment variable) 
 - it checks if the 'file_name' is already present and then gracefully exit
 - if not, it downloads the file_name - this done with with some provision to avoid requesting IP being banned - and ensure some retry until the file is downloaded
 - if the file_name extension is not pdf, it identify the file extension then it converts it to pdf

### download_documents

>      download_documents (doc_table)


Here is the file conversion functions that assumes that [libre-office](https://www.libreoffice.org/download/download-libreoffice/) is installed locally.


```{bash}
# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt install libreoffice

# Mac (Homebrew)
brew install --cask libreoffice
```

[source](https://github.com/iom/evaluation_knowledge/blob/main/evaluation_knowledge/core.py#L449){target="_blank" style="float:right; font-size:smaller"}

### convert_file_to_pdf

>      convert_file_to_pdf (input_path, output_path)

*Converts Word, Excel, or PowerPoint file to PDF using LibreOffice in headless mode.
Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.*


---

[source](https://github.com/iom/evaluation_knowledge/blob/main/evaluation_knowledge/core.py#L413){target="_blank" style="float:right; font-size:smaller"}

### find_libreoffice_exec

>      find_libreoffice_exec ()

*Finds the appropriate LibreOffice command based on OS.
Returns path to LibreOffice CLI tool or raises an error.*


Testing this...

::: {#cell-37 .cell}
``` {.python .cell-code}
doc_table = db.open_table("documents")
os.environ["PDF_Library"] = "Evaluation_Library"
download_documents(doc_table)
```
:::


### Now load file content in the vector DB, chunk and embedd

Building a function that 
 - this function takes an argument the `doc_table` from the vector DB (`doc_table = db.open_table("documents")`). this table includes document_id, url, and evaluation_id, processed
 - then for each document, and in parallelised way, it loads the url and extract the `file_name` from the `url` within the table
 - it assume a local `file_path` with `PDF_Library`/`evaluation_id`/`file_name` (where `PDF_Library` is an environment variable - `file_name` is extracted from the url - and the `file_name` extension is sanitised to include systematically '.pdf' ) 
 - It will extract the text from the PDF using PyMuPDF with error handling
-- it will implement the  It will then fill in the chunk table in lancedb, implementing a late chunking approach to avoid duplicate embedding computation, ensure context-aware chunk boundaries and precise span tracking .
- the lancedb chunk table schema should be 
    - chunk_id: str
    - document_id: str
    - evaluation_id: str
    - metadata: dict[str, str] 
    - content: str = embedding_fn.SourceField()
    - vector: Vector(embedding_fn.ndims()) = embedding_fn.VectorField() 
- Once processed the  processed variable in doc_table is set to true   


Test the embeddings through lanchain....

::: {#cell-39 .cell}
``` {.python .cell-code}
test_embedding = embedding_model.embed_query("Hello world")
print(f"Embedding vector length: {len(test_embedding)}")
embedding_dim = len(test_embedding)
# LanceDB-compatible wrapper
class LangchainEmbeddingWrapper:
    def __init__(self, langchain_embedder):
        self._embedder = langchain_embedder

    def __call__(self, texts):
        return self._embedder.embed_documents(texts)
        
    def ndims(self):
        return self._dim

# Wrap and use
embedding_fn = LangchainEmbeddingWrapper(embedding_model)
#print("Embedding dimension:", embedding_fn.ndims())

vec = embedding_fn(["Hello world"])
print(f"Vector through lancedb dim: {len(vec[0])}")
print(embedding_fn(["Hello world"])[0])
```
:::


::: {#cell-40 .cell}
``` {.python .cell-code}
print(dir(embedding_fn))
help(embedding_fn)
```
:::


So first we create the chunk table in lancedb 

::: {#cell-42 .cell}
``` {.python .cell-code}
from pydantic import BaseModel
from lancedb.pydantic import Vector
import pyarrow as pa 
pa_schema = pa.schema([
    pa.field("chunk_id", pa.string()),
    pa.field("document_id", pa.string()),
    pa.field("evaluation_id", pa.string()),
    pa.field("metadata", pa.string()),  # storing metadata dict as JSON string for simplicity
    pa.field("content", pa.string()),
    pa.field("vector", pa.list_(pa.float32(), embedding_dim)),  # vector as list of floats
])

from lancedb import connect
db = connect(LANCE_DB_PATH)
chunk_table = db.create_table("chunks", schema=pa_schema)
```
:::


and then the function creating embeddings chunck for each document


---

### process_documents_to_chunks

>      process_documents_to_chunks (doc_table, chunk_table)


Now let's run this! 

::: {#cell-46 .cell}
``` {.python .cell-code}
LANCE_DB_PATH = "./lancedb"
from lancedb import connect
db = connect(LANCE_DB_PATH)
doc_table = db.open_table("documents")
chunk_table = db.open_table("chunks")
process_documents_to_chunks(doc_table, chunk_table)
```
:::

### check_chunk_status

>      check_chunk_status (doc_table, chunk_table)


::: {#cell-49 .cell}
``` {.python .cell-code}
LANCE_DB_PATH = "./lancedb"
from lancedb import connect
db = connect(LANCE_DB_PATH)
doc_table = db.open_table("documents")
chunk_table = db.open_table("chunks")
missing_docs_df = check_chunk_status(doc_table, chunk_table)
print(missing_docs_df)
# this table includes document_id, url, and evaluation_id
```
:::


### Generating AI-Enhanced metadata 

Last, we run a function to generate metadata... 

The function will load the "evaluations" table within the db --connect(LANCE_DB_PATH) --
then loop around each evaluation_id within the "chunks" table to retrive the context - and 
perform an LLM call to then generate as an output additional metadata
Then it will update the evaluations table with the output for each evaluation -
At the end it will save a json file with a dump of the evaluations table

### clean_json

>      clean_json (obj)

*Recursively clean an object to make it JSON serializable, handling None values.*


We will use the  __PICO structured framework__ as an approach to represent the causal knowledge found in the Evaluation (cf. [EconBERTa: Towards Robust Extraction of Named Entities in Economics](https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-emnlp.774.pdf)). This scheme helps in systematically organizing and analyzing the effectiveness of interventions by comparing outcomes between groups:

__1. Population (P)__:  The group of individuals or units (e.g., households, schools, firms) affected by the intervention. The target population shall be clearly defined (e.g., smallholder farmers, primary school students, unemployed youth) and it shall Include eligibility criteria (e.g., age, socioeconomic status, geographic location).

__2. Intervention (I)__: The program, policy, or treatment whose effect is being evaluated. Describes the active component being tested (e.g., cash transfers, training workshops, new teaching methods). Should specify dosage, duration, and delivery mechanism.

__3. Comparators (C)__: The counterfactual scenario—what would have happened without the intervention. Ideally involves a control group (if the study approach is randomized or quasi-experimental) that does not receive the intervention. Alternatively refers to "Business-as-usual" groups, placebo interventions, or different treatment arms.

__4. Outcome (O)__:The measurable effects or endpoints used to assess the intervention’s impact. Includes primary outcomes (main indicators of interest, e.g., school enrollment rates, income levels) and secondary outcomes (e.g., health, empowerment). Should be specific, measurable, and time-bound (e.g., "child literacy scores after 12 months").


Using such approach, we can ensure Clarity (the research question is well-defined and testable), Causal Inference (isolate the effect of the intervention by comparing treated and untreated groups), Replicability (to potentially extrapolate the findings) and Relevance (linking outcomes to real-world decision-making).

## Step 3: Cross-Evaluation Analysis




## Step 4: Generate Actionable and Generalizable Insights  

One key challenge is How to generalize the findings from an evaluation from one place to another one? The [Generalizability Framework](https://ssir.org/articles/entry/the_generalizability_puzzle) provides some insights on how to do that.


To implement this we will generate insights using AI-enabled Q&A on all previous Q&A:


```{python} 
def generate_insights(df):
    # Add your insight generation logic here
    return df

df = generate_insights(df)
```


## Step 5: Identify Patterns and Gaps

Identify patterns and gaps in the data:


```{python} 
def identify_patterns(df):
    # Add your pattern identification logic here
    return df

df = identify_patterns(df)
```

```{python} 
def generate_deliverables(df):
    # Generate Q&A dataset
    qa_dataset = df[['question', 'answer']]

    # Generate synthesis report
    synthesis_report = df.describe()

    # Generate visual evidence map
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    sns.scatterplot(data=df, x='outcome', y='population', size='sample_size')
    plt.title('Visual Evidence Map')
    plt.show()

    return qa_dataset, synthesis_report

qa_dataset, synthesis_report = generate_deliverables(df)
```


Visualize Patterns & Gaps


```{python} 
# Convert QA to structured fields (intervention, outcome, population, etc.)
qa_df = pd.json_normalize(df_docs["qa"].apply(json.loads))

# Bubble Map Example
fig = px.scatter(qa_df, x="geography", y="outcome",
                 size="sample_size", color="intervention",
                 hover_name="file_name",
                 title="Evidence Bubble Map")
fig.show()

# Heatmap Example
heatmap_df = pd.crosstab(qa_df["intervention"], qa_df["outcome"])
sns.heatmap(heatmap_df, annot=True, cmap="coolwarm")
```

```{python} 
def create_interactive_visualizations(extracted_data: pd.DataFrame):
    """Enhanced visualization functions"""
    # Prepare data
    df = extracted_data.explode("source_urls")

    strength_dist = df['evidence_strength'].value_counts().reset_index()
    fig1 = px.bar(

## Conclusions - and potential extension...

* Web interface (Streamlit, Gradio, etc.)

* Periodic syncing with new evaluations via web scraping

* Integration with Hugging Face for fine-tuning a summarization or Q&A model
