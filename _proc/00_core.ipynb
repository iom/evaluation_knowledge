    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, configure visual Studio Code to use the virtual environment: Open the Command Palette using the shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+P` and type `Jupyter: Select Interpreter` and select the interpreter that corresponds to your newly created virtual environment: `('venv': venv)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Required Python Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "Once this environment selected as a kernel to run the notebook, we can install the required python modules the rest of the process:\n",

[EconBERTa: Towards Robust Extraction of Named Entities in Economics](https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-emnlp.774.pdf)). This scheme helps in systematically organizing and analyzing the effectiveness of interventions by comparing outcomes between groups:\n",
    "\n",
    "__1. Population (P)__:  The group of individuals or units (e.g., households, schools, firms) affected by the intervention. The target population shall be clearly defined (e.g., smallholder farmers, primary school students, unemployed youth) and it shall Include eligibility criteria (e.g., age, socioeconomic status, geographic location).\n",
    "\n",
    "__2. Intervention (I)__: The program, policy, or treatment whose effect is being evaluated. Describes the active component being tested (e.g., cash transfers, training workshops, new teaching methods). Should specify dosage, duration, and delivery mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "__3. Comparators (C)__: The counterfactual scenario—what would have happened without the intervention. Ideally involves a control group (if the study approach is randomized or quasi-experimental) that does not receive the intervention. Alternatively refers to \"Business-as-usual\" groups, placebo interventions, or different treatment arms.\n",
    "\n",
    "__4. Outcome (O)__:The measurable effects or endpoints used to assess the intervention’s impact. Includes primary outcomes (main indicators of interest, e.g., school enrollment rates, income levels) and secondary outcomes (e.g., health, empowerment). Should be specific, measurable, and time-bound (e.g., \"child literacy scores after 12 months\").\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Using such approach, we can ensure Clarity (the research question is well-defined and testable), Causal Inference (isolate the effect of the intervention by comparing treated and untreated groups), Replicability (to potentially extrapolate the findings) and Relevance (linking outcomes to real-world decision-making).\n",
